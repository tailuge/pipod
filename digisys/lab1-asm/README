A program with an subroutine written in assembly language.  The main
program (written in C) prompts for two unsigned integers x, y on the
serial console, then calls a subroutine foo(x, y) and prints the
result.  The supplied code has definitions foo(x, y) = x + y and
foo(x, y) = x * y (using a loop), but you are invited to redefine it
in various ways.

TASKS: Compile and run the program as it stands.  Write alternative
assembly language code for one or more of the following functions.

1. Subtraction
2. Multiplication using the muls instruction
3. Experiment with other binary operations
4. Multiplication with a faster looping algorithm
5. Division by repeated subtraction
6. Division with a faster algorithm
